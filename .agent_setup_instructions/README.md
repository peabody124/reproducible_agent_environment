# Agent Setup Instructions

This directory contains instructions for AI agents to properly configure themselves for RAE (Reproducible Agent Environment) development.

**For agents:** Read and follow `setup-checklist.md` to ensure you're properly configured.

**For humans:** This directory helps agents self-configure. You shouldn't need to do anything here.
